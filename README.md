## go-flipper

Control your Flipper Zero over Protobuf RPC protocol.

---

This library is designed to be transport agnostic, though I've tested it with RPC over VCP only.

**The library is in a draft state. TODO:**
- cover with godoc
- refactor the progressCallback crap
- better storage read/write implementation
- implement VCP transport out of the box
- set up proper git flow, CI, etc
- prepare a cool readme with some fashionable badges :>
